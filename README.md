===========================

team project for CS6322


Data Structures
---------------
These will mostly be python dicts of string -> string unless mentioned otherwise

1.  citation -> paper
2.  paper -> citation
3.  author -> paper

If needed: paper -> paper text

 * paper - filename of paper (or title?)
 * citation - full text of the citation...  if we find citations in different formats, we could convert it
 * author will take additional parsing
